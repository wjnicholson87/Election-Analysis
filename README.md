## Election Audit Summary
This is an example of code used in Python that can quickly evaluate large data sets and output specified information. With minor altercations, this code can be used for any election. Modifications to variables, list, and dictionaries within the code can expand and/or refine our ability to analyze voter data. It is better to use Python, over Excel, for a many reasons. Python can work on a larger scale, perform much more automation, provides more transparency and is easier to reproduce. (Folkman, 2020)
